# Project Description:

In this project we will conduct research on the U.S. Electric Vehicles (EV) market, specifically, the Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) segment that has caused quite a stir in the automobile industry these last few years.

We will start by visualizing a past sales trend of the EV market in comparison to gasoline prices, to get an idea of how the market has evolved over time and how gasoline prices might correlate with the sales of EVs. 

Next, we will use three bubble charts to visualize how the major competitors in the market have changed from 2016 to 2018, with key data of each competing modelâ€™s price and fuel efficiency ratings.
